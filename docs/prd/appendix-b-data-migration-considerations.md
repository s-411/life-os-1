# Appendix B: Data Migration Considerations

When transitioning existing Life OS users from local storage to Supabase:

**Existing Features Mapped to Module System**:
- Deep Work Sessions → Can remain as dedicated feature OR migrate to Binary module
- Winners Bible Morning/Night → Can remain as dedicated feature OR migrate to Binary modules
- Custom Metrics (Story 7.9) → **Should** migrate to Module System for consistency

**Migration Strategy**:
1. Preserve existing 25 functional requirements as-is (no breaking changes)
2. Introduce Module System as additive feature
3. Future releases can optionally refactor "Custom Metrics" into modules
4. Maintain backward compatibility for data exports from local storage version

*This Product Requirements Document provides comprehensive specifications for building the Life OS as a Supabase-native, multi-user web application. All features are designed for cloud-based data storage with real-time synchronization, secure authentication, and complete data isolation between users. The application delivers comprehensive health tracking with an emphasis on precise calculations, data-driven insights, and an engaging user experience powered by the distinctive Design System.*

*The Modular Habits & Lifestyle Tracking System (FR26) provides architectural extensibility, enabling unlimited future expansion of tracking capabilities without PRD modifications. See Appendix A for module framework specifications.*
