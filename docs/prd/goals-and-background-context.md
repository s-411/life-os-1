# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- **Comprehensive Health Tracking**: Provide users with a unified platform to track daily health metrics, nutrition, exercise, injections, and personal development activities

## Background Context

Life OS addresses the fragmented landscape of health tracking applications by providing an all-in-one solution built on modern cloud infrastructure. Current health tracking solutions force users to juggle multiple apps for different aspects of their health journey, leading to data silos and incomplete insights.

This application consolidates daily activity tracking, calorie/macro management, injection/medication schedules, mobility training (Nirvana), and motivational systems into a unified, intelligent platform. Built on Supabase, the application provides real-time synchronization, secure authentication, and scalable data management while maintaining a distinctive dark-themed design system that emphasizes readability and user experience.

The platform targets health-conscious individuals who demand precision tracking, data ownership, and actionable insightsâ€”particularly those managing complex health protocols involving nutrition optimization, performance enhancement, and detailed biomarker tracking.
