# Epic 5: Nirvana Life & Winners Bible

**Epic Goal**: Develop the Nirvana mobility/gymnastics tracking system and Winners Bible motivational image viewer. Users can track their physical training sessions, manage custom session types, and engage with a daily motivational routine using their own images.

## Story 5.1: Nirvana Session Tracking System

I want **to log completion of Nirvana Life training sessions with different session types**,
so that **I can track my consistency with mobility and gymnastics practice**.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

   - `id` (UUID, primary key)
   - `user_id` (UUID, foreign key to auth.users, not null)
   - `date` (DATE, not null)
   - `session_type` (TEXT, not null)
   - `completed` (BOOLEAN, default true)
   - `completed_at` (TIMESTAMP, not null)
   - `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)
2. RLS policy: Users can CRUD only their own sessions (user_id = auth.uid())
3. Index on (user_id, date) for fast queries
4. Nirvana page created at `/app/nirvana/page.tsx`
5. Page title "Nirvana Life" with current date
6. "Today's Session" card displays:
   - Session type dropdown (populated from user's configured session types)
