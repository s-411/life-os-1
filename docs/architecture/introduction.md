# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for Life OS, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**Status:** Greenfield project - No starter template

This is a greenfield Next.js 14+ application built from scratch with Supabase as the backend. We're not using any fullstack starter templates, allowing us to maintain full control over the architecture while following Next.js and Supabase best practices.
